# London_Weather_Prediction
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the mean temperature based on various weather features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation along with Experiment tracking with MLflow, allowing easy comparison of model parameters and performance metrics to identify the best performing model.
